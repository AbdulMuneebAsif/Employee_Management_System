# Employee Management System

## Overview

The Employee Management System is a C++ project designed to manage employee data efficiently. It is built using CMake and utilizes the Ninja build system for fast and efficient compilation. The project is structured to be easily extendable and maintainable, with a focus on modularity and clarity.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key components:

- **CMakeLists.txt**: The main configuration file for CMake, specifying the project details and build instructions.
- **Source Files**: 
- `main.cpp`: The entry point of the application.
- `Implementation.cpp`: Contains the core logic and implementation details.
- **Header Files**:
- `Node.h`: Defines the structure and operations for a node, likely used in data structures.
- `List.h`: Provides list operations, possibly for managing collections of nodes or employee records.

## Build System

The project uses CMake (version 3.30 or higher) and Ninja as the build system. The build configuration is set to `Debug` mode by default, which includes debugging symbols for easier troubleshooting and development.

### Key Build Files

- **CMakeCache.txt**: Stores the configuration settings for the build.
- **build.ninja**: Generated by CMake, this file contains the build instructions for Ninja.
- **CMakeConfigureLog.yaml**: Logs the configuration process, including system and compiler details.

## Compilation and Linking

The project is compiled using the GNU C++ compiler with the following flags:

- `-g`: Includes debugging information.
- `-std=gnu++11`: Specifies the C++11 standard with GNU extensions.
- `-fdiagnostics-color=always`: Enables colored diagnostics for better readability.

The linking process is handled by the GNU linker, and the output is an executable named `Employee_Management_System`.

## Installation

The default installation prefix is `/usr/local`, but this can be customized by setting the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable during the CMake configuration.

## Testing

The project includes a basic testing setup, as indicated by the `LastTest.log` file. However, detailed test cases and frameworks are not specified in the provided snippets.

## Environment and Tools

- **CMake**: Version 3.30
- **Ninja**: Version 1.12.1
- **Compiler**: GNU C++ (version 13.3.0)
- **Linker**: GNU ld (version 2.42)

## How to Build

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Employee_Management_System
```

2. **Configure the Build**:

```

## Future Enhancements

- **Testing**: Implement comprehensive test cases to ensure the reliability and correctness of the system.
- **Documentation**: Expand the documentation to include detailed descriptions of each module and function.
- **Features**: Add more features to manage employee data, such as search, update, and delete operations.
